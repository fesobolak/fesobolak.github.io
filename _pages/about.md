I am a third year Linguistics PhD student at Cornell University. My theoretical interests include morphology, morphosyntax, and the syntax-semantics interface. My research goals extend beyond my theoretical interests. I spend much of my time working with Indigenous language data, with the ultimate goal of language documentation and revitalization.


I acknowledge the Bitterroot, Upper Pend d'Oreille, and Kootenia tribes whose language, Montana Salish, I research.


Cornell University is located on Gayogo̱hó:nǫ́ land. The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' presence here, where I live and work, precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York State, and the United States of America.

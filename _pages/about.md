I am a third year Linguistics PhD student at Cornell University. My interests include morphology, morphosyntax, and indigenous languages. My research goals extend beyond my theoretical interests, though. I like to consider the bridge between fieldwork linguists and the computational side of building websites for language learning material, online dictionaries, texts and audio, etc. I am currently focused on learning the computational skills necessary in order to foster that bridge (such as Python and corpus-based tools).

I am a third year Linguistics PhD student at Cornell University. My theoretical interests include morphology, morphosyntax, and the syntax-semantics interface. My research goals extend beyond my theoretical interests. I spend much of my time working with Indigenous language data, with the ultimate goal of language documentation and revitalization.

I am a member and web admin of the Cornell Language Documentation Lab (CLDL). I am also a member of the University of British Columbia's Salish Working Group (SWG), which focuses on Salish language linguistics, documentation, and fieldwork methodologies.


I acknowledge the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (T̓at̓ayáqn Séliš), including the Bitterroot and Upper Pend d'Oreille, whose language (Séliš) I research.


Cornell University is located on Gayogo̱hó:nǫ́ land. The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' presence here, where I live and work, precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York State, and the United States of America.
